# MPI Job RFE Prompt

## Overview

Create an RFE.md following the template. Do not go beyond that step.

## RFE Requirements

Build an RFE for MPIJobs support in the latest Red Hat OpenShift AI version, using KubeFlow Trainer V2 latest capabilities for MPI.

This integration should add MPIJobs from CLI, SDK, and ODH Dashboard UI perspectives, providing users with observability for MPIJobs together with other KubeFlow Trainer Jobs.

Focus on creating a clear and concise RFE that addresses:

- User value
- Technical requirements
- Implementation approaches
- Enterprise considerations (security and scalability)

## Key Context

### Target Users

- Data Scientists
- MLOps Engineers
- OpenShift AI Administrators

### Integration Approach

Follow Kubeflow Trainer V2 best practices for MPI Jobs.

### Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: KubeFlow Trainer V2 support in Red Hat OpenShift AI must be implemented first

### Technical Considerations

> **Note**: These should be added during the specification phase (not as part of the RFE).

The following technical areas should be addressed:

1. **Integration and Deployment Architecture**
2. **Networking and Inter-process Communication (IPC)**
3. **Resource Orchestration and Scheduling**
4. **Hardware Acceleration and Runtime**
5. **Required Software and Data Services**
6. **Operational and Non-Functional Requirements**
7. **Monitoring, Logging, and Debugging**
8. **Security and Access Control**
9. **User Experience (UI/UX) and Documentation**
