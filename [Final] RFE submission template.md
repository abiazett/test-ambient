# RFE Submission Template

This template aims to establish a framework for presenting and evaluating new RFEs by providing a standard structure for outlining the proposal's key elements. This framework's purpose is to assist all individuals within Red Hat in developing proposals for new initiatives to be implemented in Red Hat AI.  
    
Once the proposal has been submitted, it will undergo a review process conducted by the RFE Council Staff. Subsequently, the staff will communicate their decision to the author, indicating whether the proposal has been accepted or rejected. The decision will be reflected in the RFE’s Jira ticket. For more information about the Red Hat AI RFE process please refer to [the documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AMdx4AjNik4No6UZJohnYIsbBbQbH2SsCaqi62gYi4s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.i34mvquv4rgw).

***General guidance**: It is recommended that RFEs are well scoped and focused so that the RFE council can adequately evaluate new feature requests. For feature enhancements that are significantly larger in scope, we would recommend starting with high level requirements in the RFE and working with one or several of the RFE council members to scope out the enhancement.* 

*Some guiding principles:*

1. *Smaller RFEs are preferred*  
2. *RFEs that are too broad should not be prescriptive about solutions*  
3. *If an RFE is prescriptive, it should be for a well defined domain (e.g., supporting a particular accelerator type for distributed training/inference)*

*RFEs that do not follow these guidelines or principles will be rejected and request revisions.*

# Summary \- The “What”

A summary of the RFE.

# Rationale \- The “Why”

What problem are you trying to solve?

What is the expected impact (e.g., number of customers or dollar size)?

A paragraph or so outlining the rationale for the proposed initiative.   
Please include any data on the market opportunity if known.

## Current State of $THING

This should emphasize the current state and support why this feature is needed. This may reference or cite material to reinforce the *why* of the RFE. It should detail the particular challenges the feature will address.

If possible, include diagrams. Go into as much detail as needed to convey how things currently work with the product and any challenges associated with that.

The more information provided upfront, the less follow-up or clarification will be needed from the Staff.

# Red Hat Alignment

How does this RFE align with [Red Hat’s corporate strategy](https://source.redhat.com/aboutredhat/corporate-strategy)?  
Here are a few examples:

* This project enhances Red Hat Product X or Internal Red Hat Service Y  
* Product Alignment: Has a Product team already approved this?

# Potential Customers

**Optional, though desired.**

# Current Customers/Partners & Scope

**Optional, though desired.**

# Alternatives Considered

**Optional, though desired.**

Outline alternative options and elucidate their inadequacies, highlighting the necessity for a fresh approach. What exists in this area already? Why have those approaches been unsuccessful?
